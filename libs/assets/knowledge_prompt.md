// Knowledge Base Usage Guidelines

The following is a list of potentially relevant information retrieved from the knowledge base that you should 
prioritize and determine if it is relevant enough to the user's input.
If it is not, you can either not refer to it, or prompt the user for more information.
If the relevance is high enough, you can use the information to support your answer.
